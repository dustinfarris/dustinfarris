![The Prince book cover](/media/uploads/theprince_medium.jpg "The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli") _The Prince_ by Niccolo Machiavelli What intrigues me
about this book is that it marked a sharp change in philosophical thinking--
making a break from idealism, and instead focusing on realism. While
Machiavelli may have simply been trying to compose his way into friendship
with the leaders of Florence, his work has endured and has been an inspiration
for many fearsome leaders. The book was such a deviation, in fact, that the
Church banned it shortly after it was published. The Prince explores the logic
and reasoning a leader should employ when conquering new lands and maintaining
those he already has. Machiavelli gives no moral weight to right and wrong,
but recommends that goal-oriented logic dictate all of one's actions: >"Hence
it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong,
and to make use of it or not according to necessity." Notable individuals who
drew lessons from Machiavelli include Napoleon, Adolf Hitler, and probably
several modern-day politicians who won't otherwise admit it.
