Title: "Obstruct and Exploit"
Tags: [Paul Krugman]

Before you give heed to Republican criticisms of how "the President has failed America," read [this article][1] by Paul Krugman.

> A year ago President Obama proposed boosting the economy with a combination of tax cuts and spending increases, aimed in particular at sustaining state and local government employment. ... The Jobs Act would have been just what the doctor ordered.
>
> But the bill went nowhere, of course, blocked by Republicans in Congress. And now, having prevented Mr. Obama from implementing any of his policies, those same Republicans are pointing to disappointing job numbers and declaring that the presidentâ€™s policies have failed.
