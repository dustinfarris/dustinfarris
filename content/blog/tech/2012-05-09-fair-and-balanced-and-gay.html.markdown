Title: "Fair and Balanced... and GAY"
Tags: [Fox News]

President Obama declared his support for gay marriage today.
That's interesting news. What's also
interesting is how the networks differ from each other when announcing the
news.

Perhaps the differences are unnoticeable to some, but as a person who thinks
critically about webpages for a living, I couldn't help but notice how this
headline was portrayed from news site to news site--particularly with the
graphics.

Here is the Times: Simple and classic much like the rest of
their site.

CNN was also quick to get this up on the front page: decorated with a video
thumbnail and a neutral title, and presented alongside other breaking news.

Then there's our friends over at the Fair and Balanced network.
What strikes me most is the high contrast bold font they
use to scream out this headline. Coupled with a closeup
shot of the President's face and a thumbnail of two men wearing pink, I think
it's "fair" to say that the Fair and Balanced network would command more
respect (from me anyway) if it was fair, balanced, and tempered.
