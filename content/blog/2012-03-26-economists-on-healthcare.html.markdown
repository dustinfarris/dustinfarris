You don't have to be lawyer to have common sense.

> We know, or I think we know, that a single-payer system -- in which the
government collects taxes, and uses the revenue to provide health insurance --
would be constitutional. I mean, I don't think the court is about to strike
down Medicare.

> Well, ObamaRomneycare is basically a somewhat klutzy way of simulating
single-payer. Instead of collecting enough revenue to pay for universal health
insurance, it requires that those who can afford it buy the insurance
directly, then provides aid -- financed with taxes -- to those who can't. The
end result is much the same as if the government collected taxes from those
under the mandate and bought insurance for them.

> Yes, the system is surely less efficient than single-payer, both because
it's more complex and because it introduces another layer of middlemen. That's
what happens when you have to make political compromises. But it is in no
sense more interventionist, more tyrannical, than Medicare; it's just a
different way of achieving the same thing.
