Title: "Romney and Mother Jones"
Tags: [Mitt Romney]

I just want to briefly weigh in on the "47%" video published by [Mother Jones][1].  There is nothing shocking about what was said here.  Romney is in a room with his donors explaining his campaign philosophy; not his political views.  As he points out, some voters won't vote for you no matter what, so why spend the time and money trying to sway their opinion?

I don't think there is anything insulting about his reasoning and I'm sure similar generalizations  are made in the other camp.

For once, though, I am happy intellectualism plays a minor role in elections.  Notwithstanding the completely rational conversation, this is going to burn Romney.

Now can anyone explain to me how someone managed to get a hidden cam set up without the Secret Service noticing?
