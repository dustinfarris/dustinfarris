Title: "Mitt Romney and Spain"

> "I don't want to go down the path of Spain," Romney said Wednesday night during the first presidential debate. He argued that government spending under Obama has reached 42 percent of the U.S. economy, a figure comparable with America's NATO ally. "I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work."

> The remark was Romney's latest to cause international offense during a campaign that much of the world is closely monitoring.

I picked up on this too during the Oct 3 presidential debate; but my head was already spinning by that point as a result of the hail storm of you-know-what coming out of Romney's mouth.

Spain isn't doing so hot, it's true, but their lack of recovery has been due to the repulsively strict austere measures they have been putting into place.  And when that doesn't work: [more austerity][2].

So, insulting yet another foreign country aside, it's doubly amusing that Romney chose Spain in his analogy given that their "recovery" policies are very nearly the exact same policies the Republican party is advocating for here in the U.S.
