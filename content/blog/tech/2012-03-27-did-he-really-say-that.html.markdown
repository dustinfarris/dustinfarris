Title: "Did He Really Say That?"
Tags: [Mitt Romney]

Yes, he did.

In an attempt to capitalize on Obama's discussion with Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev regarding election year politics, Mitt Romney
[stated](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/26/romney-not-worried-about-santorum-labels-russia-no-1-foe/):

> Russia "is without question our number one geopolitical foe,"

As I'm sure anyone can imagine, the Russians just [loved hearing that](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/27/russian-president-lobs-hollywood-charge-at-romney/).

Medvedev:

> "My first advice is to listen to reason when they formulate their positions.
Reason never harmed a presidential candidate. My other
advice is to check their watches from time to time: it is 2012, not the mid-
1970s."
