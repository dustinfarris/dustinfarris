It looks like another year of high gas prices and failed labor negotiations
has taken the final swing at American Airlines. Today, the
airline giant filed for Chapter 11 protection. American is
the last major US carrier to join the ranks of airlines that have filed for
bankruptcy since 9/11.

This reinforces my stance as an anti-union airline employee.
While American's predicament certainly
isn't_entirely_ the fault of brutal labor negotiations,
pompous disregard for a company's financial health--such is the attitude of
all labor unions (and many of their members) I've been in contact with--seems
to only lead in one direction: cranky employees, cranky management, and a
bankrupt airline.
