Title: "The Charles Dickens Museum"
Tags: London

On a trip to London, I decided to take some time to investigate an author I
recently read, Charles Dickens. The house on 48 Doughtry
Street was occupied by the great writer between 1837 and 1839. In this period,
he produced The Pickwick Papers, and the everlasting favorite, Oliver Twist.

It was indeed a joy to climb the stairs from the wine cellar, to the ground
floor, and upwards further to the drawing room and library.
The museum has collected several pieces of furniture,
literature, and artwork that Dickens owned over the years.
The experience was quite authentic and warm, with a
friendly staff and a video documentary of Dickens prolific life.

I would highly recommend anyone with an interest in great English literature
to take a stop by this museum if one happens to have a few hours of spare time
in London. The cost of entry is Â£7 and is well worth it.
