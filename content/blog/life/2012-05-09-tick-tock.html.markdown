Title: "Tick Tock"
Tags: thoughts

It's a shame we can't live out all of our life's dreams. I
wish I could pursue music. I wish I could pursue
philosophy. I wish I could pursue geology, astronomy, and
physics. In place of all that I study computers and web
development to a level that borders madness.

Out of all areas of study in existance I am left with one that I can barely
keep up with. Why are we given such a short time to live?
Why is reality so complex? Why do we
care?
