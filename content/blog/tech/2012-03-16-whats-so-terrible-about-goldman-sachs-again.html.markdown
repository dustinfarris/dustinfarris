Title: "What's So Terrible About Goldman Sachs Again?"
Tags:

A prestigious financial firm since the 19th century, and now there are
questions raised by former Sachs executive, [Greg Smith](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html), over the corporate giant's true candor toward its clients.
So, what's really going on behind Wall Street doors?
Harvard Business Review Editorial Director Justin Fox

bottom third of the class; decent enough folks with modest ambitions. Then the
combination of bigger paychecks and higher college and grad school tuition
began driving the best students into finance. ...
And the culture of an organization composed entirely of
people who are really, really smart
and_know_they are really, really smart
may bebound to turn toxic eventually.
