The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald

An easy read that took me just short of 2 days to breeze through, I found The
Great Gatsby a fun book that was modestly entertaining.

The story is of a man who falls in love, leaves for 5 years, then returns to
reclaim his love. The Great Gatsby explores how we can
dwell on the past too much, and forget to conduct ourselves nobly in the
present.
