As I [previously mentioned][1], I have embraced [Jade][2] as a new and improved way of writing frontend markup.  As usual when learning new technologies, I've used my own website as a guinea pig.

This site's markup is now 100% written in Jade and is available for your viewing pleasure on [GitHub][3]
