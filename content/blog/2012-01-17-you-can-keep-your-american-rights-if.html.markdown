Title: "You Can Keep Your American Rights If..."
Tags: [Mitt Romney]

I want to react to [Mitt Romney's statement](http://thehill.com/video/campaign/204459-romney-booed-at-debate-for-support-of-indefinite-detentions) regarding the [newly signed bill](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s1867es/pdf/BILLS-112s1867es.pdf)
that in part allows the military to detain
_indefinitely_any _American_they feel is
afilliated with terrorism _without a trial_:

> "People who side with al Qaeda do not deserve the same rights as other
people."

Where in our constitution is it written that some people deserve more rights
than others? Or perhaps the Declaration of Independence
intended to be satirical when it read:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, thatall men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these areLife, Liberty and the pursuit
of Happiness.

If a citizen commits treason, try him for treason, but don't deny him his
American rights.

Oh, and speaking of that line from the Declaration of Independence, can we
start thinking about how it might apply to non-Americans also?
If I'm reading it correctly, being "American" isn't
actually a required qualifier at all.
