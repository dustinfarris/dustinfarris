Title: "Smart Republicans Reject Science"
Tags:

The Economist's View brought up the[interesting point](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/02/make-them-identify-emotionally.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+EconomistsView+%28Economist%27s+View+%28EconomistsView%29%29) today
that a lot of what drives Republican politics revolves more around emotion
rather than science and education. Furthermore, education
seems to actually perpetuate this anomaly.

Given the facts of global warming and human involvment, [Chris Mooney](http://www.alternet.org/story/154252/the_republican_brain:_why_even_educated_conservatives_deny_science_--_and_reality/?page=entire) cites a [2008 Pew report](http://www.people-press.org/2008/05/08/a-deeper-partisan-divide-over-global-warming/) showing the "partisan divide over the reality of global
warming." Of interest is this chart showing not only the
belief differences between Republicans, Independents, and Democrats, but also
between the less and more educated.

Mooney talks about the effect these numbers had on him:

> For Republicans, having a college degree didn't appear to make one any more
open to what scientists have to say. On the contrary, better-educated
Republicans were more skeptical of modern climate science than their less
educated brethren. ...This was my first encounter with what
I now like to call the "smart idiots" effect: The fact that politically
sophisticated or knowledgeable people are often more biased, and less
persuadable, than the ignorant. It's a reality that generates endless
frustration for many scientists--and indeed, for many well-educated,
reasonable people...

And [Digby](http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/tribal-solidarity-more-important-than.html) goes on to draw the parallel with emotion which I think
is brilliant:

> ...Ultimately, this is about tribalism, feeling part of a group, being
validated by it and thinking and behaving in ways that preserve your place in
it. We all do it to some extent...

Things finally are making sense.
