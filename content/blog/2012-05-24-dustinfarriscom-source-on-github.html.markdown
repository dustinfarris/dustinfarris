Title: "Dustinfarris.com Source on GitHub"
Tags:

My website is at a point where I feel comfortable making the source code public.  As of today, it is available as a [public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dustinfarris/dustinfarris).

I've taken inspiration from other sites such as [David Cramer](https://github.com/dcramer/dcramer.github.com)'s blog and even [Django's website](https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com) itself.  I believe that being able to prod through working examples can be just as useful, sometimes even more useful, than reading tutorials and howtos.  I am proud to support an open philosophy where developers can freely learn from each other.
