Title: "Points to Consider"

>  1. The economy isn't like an individual family that earns a certain amount
>     and spends some other amount, with no relationship between the two. My
>     spending is your income and your spending is my income. If we both slash
>     spending, both of our incomes fall.
>
>  2. We are now in a situation in which many people have cut spending, either
>     because they chose to or because their creditors forced them to, while
>     relatively few people are willing to spend more. The result is depressed
>     incomes and a depressed economy, with millions of willing workers unable
>     to find jobs.
>
>  3. Things aren't always this way, but when they are, the government is not
>     in competition with the private sector. Government purchases donâ€™t use
>     resources that would otherwise be producing private goods, they put
>     unemployed resources to work. Government borrowing doesn't crowd out
>     private borrowing, it puts idle funds to work. As a result, now is a time
>     when the government should be spending more, not less. If we ignore this
>     insight and cut government spending instead, the economy will shrink and
>     unemployment will rise. In fact, even private spending will shrink,
>     because of falling incomes.
>
>  4. This view of our problems has made correct predictions over the past four
>     years, while alternative views have gotten it all wrong. Budget deficits
>     haven't led to soaring interest rates (and the Fed's "money-printing"
>     hasn't led to inflation); austerity policies have greatly deepened
>     economic slumps almost everywhere they have been tried.
>
>  5. Yes, the government must pay its bills in the long run. But spending cuts
>     and/or tax increases should wait until the economy is no longer
>     depressed, and the private sector is willing to spend enough to produce
>     full employment.
