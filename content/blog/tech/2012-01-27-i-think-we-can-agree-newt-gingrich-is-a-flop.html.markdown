Title: "I think we can agree Newt Gingrich is a Flop"
Tags:

Based on a [pathetic display](http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/27/opinion/bennett-florida-debate/index.html) of ill-prepared attacks directed at Mitt Romeny
during last night's debate, I believe I can finally mark off Newt Gingrich on
America's potential nightmare list.

Not only did last night make Newt look like a tool, I found his comments to be
quite revealing about how fake politicians can be in a debate.
His tone and facial expressions made Romney's investments
seem heart-crushing. Yet, as it turns out, they were mutual
funds carrying investments some of which are shared by funds held by Newt!
Clearly Newt (incorrectly) thought he had an opportunity to
put on the actor's mask and drive home some political dirt.

It's all very sad.
