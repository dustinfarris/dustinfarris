I made a delightful discovery the other day. This Pinot is
fantastic both with dinner and by itself. It contains great
oaky characteristics, and is not overpowering. Not for
those with a sweet tooth (most Pinots aren't), but definitately a win for the
casual wine drinker (me). Best of all, it can be bought for
under $10! This is the first Pinot in that price range that
I've tried and liked, and, luckily for me, the wine shop down the street from
my NYC apartment keeps it regularly stocked.

For a great wine around $8.99, trya 2009 Lucky Star Pinot
Noir.
