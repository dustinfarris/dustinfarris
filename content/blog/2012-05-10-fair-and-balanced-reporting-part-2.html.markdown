Title: "Fair and Balanced Reporting (part 2)"
Tags: [Fox News]

Yes, I spent another 30 seconds checking out Fox News' website today--which is
30 more seconds than could possibly have been healthy for me.
[As it did before](/2012/5/fair-and-balanced-and-gay/), it
blows my mind how such a wide reaching news network can stoop to posting
tabloid-level headlines on the front page like this one:

Oh, and when you're done reading the Fair and Balanced news you can
participate in a Fair and Balanced poll:

Fox News is a joke.
