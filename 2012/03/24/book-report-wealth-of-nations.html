<p>Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith</p>
<p>An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations--yes, that's
the full title--is one of the first pieces of literature written on economics
(which technically was not even a field at the time). Adam
Smith takes a 1700's world bubbling over with discovery, and attempts to
explain monetary and behavioral trends, where they stem from, and what the
future might hold. In doing so, he created one of the most
influential texts of all time that is still widely referenced today.</p>
<p>While many of the examples throughout are significantly outdated, much of the
wisdom is not pecuniary at all and, in a philosophical sense, is very
applicable in our present world. It is the philosophy
of_Wealth of Nations_that impacted me
the most.</p>
<p>The first point Adam Smith makes, and refers to throughout the entire book, is
that productivity is increased substantially by the "division of labor."
Assigning simple minute tasks to individual workers allows
them to become proficient quickly, and results in increased output overall.
A thoughtful person might, however, be concerned that this
narrowing of scope of a man's daily work could be detrimental to realizing
human potential. Adam Smith recognizes the
corephenomenon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference of natural talents in different men is, in reality, much less
than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears to
distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is not
upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of
labour. (Book I, Chapter II, p. 23)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view, this might have a domino effect over the course of an individual's
life rendering a person stubborn and ignorant. Adam Smith
agrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of
which the effects too are, perhaps, always the same, or very nearly the same,
has no occasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention in
finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur.
He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion,
and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human
creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him, not
only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation,
but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment and consequently of
forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of
private life. Of the great and extensive interests of his
country, he is altogether incapable of judging; and unless very particular
pains have been taken to render him otherwise, he is equally incapable of
defending his country in war. The uniformity of his
stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind, and makes him
regard with abhorrence the irregular, uncertain, and adventurous life of a
soldier. It corrupts even the activity of his body, and
renders him incapable of exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance,
in any other employment than that to which he has been bred.
His dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this
manner, to be acquired at the expence of his intellectual, social, and martial
virtues. But in every improved and civilized society this
is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the
people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent
it. (Book V, Chapter I, pp. 429-30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe within every person there is a desire to better not just one's
condition, but, more importantly, to better oneself as a thing of value.
It is this driving desire, I think, that has led to the
great innovations mankind has imagined and produced in science, philosophy,
and art. I feel that a man, when his eyes are opened to his
own potential, tastes a power more addictive than money or fame.
Smith describes a related scenario
in_Wealth of Nations_ when he refers to the American colony
leaders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost every individual of the governing party in America, fills, at present
in his own fancy, a station superior, not only to what he had ever filled
before, but to what he had ever expected to fill; and unless some new object
of ambition is presented either to him or to his leaders, if he has the
ordinary spirit of a man, he will die in defence of that station.
(Book IV, Chapter VII, p. 363)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the individual aspiring to gain wisdom and improve his self-
worth is the person who spends his life bathing himself in whatever riches he
can attain. A "wantonness of plenty," Smith explains, is
more appropriate when considering the "play-things of children than the
serious pursuits of men."</p>
<p>Surely, hardly anyone can claim to be completely free of profligacy over the
entire course of life, but there is a trap that we must be careful not to slip
into. Smith hints at irony between the expenses we can
afford on others versus our own selves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In countries where a rich man can spend his revenue in no other way than by
maintaining as many people as it can maintain, he is not apt to run out, and
his benevolence it seems is seldom so violent as to attempt to maintain more
than he can afford. But where he can spend the greatest
revenue upon his own person, he frequently has no bounds to his expence,
because he frequently has no bounds to his vanity, or to his affection for his
own person. (Book III, Chapter IV, p. 267)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith notes that being overly generous to others, however, is not appropriate
behavior either due to the effects it has on society. Money
placed in unproductive hands, Smith writes, is immediately consumed and does
not benefit the opulence of the public at all. There is
surely, then, a balance between freely giving away all of one's riches, and
self-indulgence.</p>
<p>An interesting factor of wealth is the envy it creates among those who don't
have it, or who don't have "enough" of it. Smith argues
that the evolution of government is a direct result of this envy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often
both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. ... The
acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therfore, necessarily requires
the establishment of civil government. Where there is no
property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour,
civil government is not so necessary. (Book V, Chapter I,
p. 408)</p>
<p>Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property,
is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor.
(Book V, Chapter I, p. 413)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In government, at least in ours, it seems as if there are at least 2 differing
views. One view that believes in tradition and austerity,
and another that propones progression and expansive spending.
In the United States--and I confess to generalize and
stereotype--we have Republicans and Democrats. Apparently
this a much more global situation than I knew, according to Smith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In every society where the distinction of ranks has once been completely
established, there have been always two different schemes or systems of
morality current at the same time; of which the one may be called the strict
or austere; the other the liberal, or, if you will, the loose system.
The former is generally admired and revered by the common
people: The latter is commonly more esteemed and adopted by
what are called people of fashion. (Book V, Chapter I, p.
438)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Smith was really on to something here. He goes on
to draw parallels between the adoption of religion and the moral strictness of
"the common people."</p>
<p>In all, there is a wealth of knowledge in the <em>Wealth of Nations</em>, and it is
intriguing to detect the similarities of the people of Adam Smith's world and
the people of our own. Economic understanding may have
changed greatly in 2+ centuries, but human nature, it seems, hasn't.</p>
