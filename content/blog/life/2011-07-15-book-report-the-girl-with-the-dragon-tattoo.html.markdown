The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson

I began noticing this book all over the airports about 2 years
ago. It's hard to miss due to the bright green glossy
cover, and the fact that everyone reading it seemed to be absorbed like they
were uncovering the meaning of life.

At first I laughed off the title. What guy reads a book
about a girl? Then a buddy of mine read it and gave me the
real low down. Murder mystery?
Suspense? Computer hacking? Bouts with
evil antagonists hiding in Europe? More
hacking? I bought it the next day.

The book lives up to its reputation. I have never been on
reading lockdown like I was with The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo. At one point I was staying at my mother's, reading
on her couch all night until 9am when I passed out cold.

The story is about Lizbeth, a mid-20's loner who has a shady background and
knows more about computer hacking than anyone could ever suspect at face
value. She teams up with a 40-something reporter who is
hired to solve a murder mystery in northern Sweden. The
book takes sharp turns regularly, and keeps you saying to yourself, "oh no,
it's not going to go there, that's not going to happen," and then it does.

The story is captivating, the characters are solid. Anyone
looking for entertainment that doesn't spray a thousand lux into your eyes
should pick up The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
