Remember in Star Trek when the operations officer (usually Commander Data) was
scanning for "M-class" planets? Well, it looks like we mere
humans of the 21st century don't need a galaxy-class starship to do the same.
This monstrosity (about 2 and a half times the size of
Earth) was just discovered recently, and has temperatures inhabitable by
humans. The downside is it happens to be 600 light years
away from our species.

If you ask me, the obvious next step is a spaceship that flies at 60-light-
years/hour.
