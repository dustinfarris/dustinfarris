I had an opportunity recently to visit the British Museum in London, and came
across a [gallery](http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/themes/room_24_living_and_dying.aspx) themed "Living and Dying." It is
an intriguing collection of artifacts that represent how humans deal with self
preservation, sickness, and death around the world.

I found myself fascinated with how differently various cultures view these
universal effects of life. For instance, when people get
sick, some cultures pray, some dance, some invent medicine, and some do all of
the above; but what remains the inescapable truth is that we all react to
sickness and death.
