1984 by George Orwell

If you want a terrifying glimpse into the future of mankind, read this book.
Orwell tells a story of a time when citizens are controlled
in every way, and wars are waged just to get rid of surplus.


"The Party" dominates the people of the 1984 world, watching their every move,
listening to every spoken word, and eliminating anyone who might threaten
their manifesto:

> "War is peace. Freedom is slavery.
Ignorance is strength."

The source of the phrase "Big Brother," 1984 shows us that when humanist
philosophy goes out the window, totalitarianismcombines
with oligarchical collectivism to create a supreme power of hate and control.
This book serves as a warning to those who believe rights
to life, liberty, and property are not worth fighting for.
