Title: "A Bad Economic Analogy"
Tags: [Paul Krugman]

Everyone has heard from the Right that government needs to "tighten its belt"
and behave like a responsible family in times of economic crisis.
[Paul Krugman](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/losing-the-belt/) blows a nice hole in this analogy:

> When a family tightens its belt it doesn't put itself out of a job. When a
government tightens its belt in a depressed economy, it puts lots of people
out of jobs; and this is a negative even from the government's own, narrowly
fiscal point of view, since a shrinking economy means less revenue.
