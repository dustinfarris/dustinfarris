Title: "Really, Missouri?  A Statue?"
Tags:

I'm with [Bill Mahr](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bill-maher-liberals-accept-rush-limbaugh-apology-sandra-fluke-move-article-1.1035029) who
recently criticized liberals for taking Rush Limbaugh's comments regarding
Sandra Fluke too far. What I'm not for is the $10,000 gold
statue of Rush that House Speaker Steve Tilley-R wants to erect in the
Jefferson City Hall of Famous Missourians.

Tilley did respond to voters concerned over Rush's recent radio stunt.

> "I'm not going to go through it and review every comment he's ever made,"
Tilley said. "Just like the people who inducted Mark Twain, Warren Hearnes or
John Ashcroft didn't."

Somehow I don't think we're comparing apples to apples here.
