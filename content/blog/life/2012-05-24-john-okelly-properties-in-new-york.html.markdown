Title: "John O&#39;Kelly Properties in New York"
Tags:

I recently gave an old client of mine a site overhaul.  His site was one of my first, and let's just say things have come a long way since I built it.

Upgrades include a brand new design (probably one of my best), a bump to Django 1.4, model restructuring, and a complete refactoring of HTML.  Check it out at [johnokelly.com](http://johnokelly.com).

Oh, and if you're looking for an apartment in Manhattan, you should definitely give him a call!
