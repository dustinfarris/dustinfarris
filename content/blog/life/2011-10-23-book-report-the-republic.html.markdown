The Republic by Plato

_The Republic_ is a beautiful dialogue that takes place between Socrates and
his friends as they explore the worth and profitability of a just man.
Throughout the writing, our hero, Socrates, utilizes
dialect to argue fundamental aspects of our soul and how its nurture or
neglect affects us in life and society.

Socrates teaches us that we should spend more time learning about ourselves
and the power of the Good. This in turn helps us understand
what we must do:

> For you have often heard that the greatest and most important study is the
Idea of the Good, by which just things and the rest become useful and
beneficial.

Socrates also points out that we must be strong in character if we are ever to
be great:

> A weak nature will never be responsible for great things, whether for good
or ill.

I find that many of the points raised in _The Republic_are
valid today. For instance, Socrates discusses the folly of
excessive praise and flattering of promising youth:

> When he becomes older, I suppose, his relatives and fellow citizens will
wish to use him for their own purposes.
>
> They will fawn on him with requests and honors, anticipating the power that
will be his and flattering it in advance.
>
> \[Then\] won't he be filled with an impossible hope, believing himself
competent to manage the affairs of Greeks and barbarians alike, exalting
himself to a great height, filled with pretense and empty pride without
intelligence?
>
> Then suppose someone came to a person in this condition and gently spoke the
truth: that intelligence is not in him, but he needs it, and that it cannot be
possessed unless he slaves for the possession of it. Do you
think it will be easy for him to listen, in the midst of these great evils?

There is also a criticism of literature, music and poetry that I believe is
especially applicable today:

> Because we shall say, I presume, that poets and prose writers therefore
speak badly about what is most important for men, claiming that many men are
happy but unjust, or just but wretched, and that the doing of injustice is
profitable if it escapes detection, while justice is another's good and one's
own loss.

I think that describes a lot of what exists in pop culture today.
It's ironic that the same air of ignorance exists today as
it did over 2000 years ago. Have we learned nothing?
Or is the ratio of wisdom to ignorance hard-coded in our
genetics somewhere?

We can learn a lot by reviewing the ground Socrates covered in this dialogue.
Plato wrote [many other great dialogues](/2011/7/book-
report-dialogues-by-plato/) as well that teach us just as much, but I place
_The Republic _at the the top.

I own [_The Republic _translated by R.E. Allen](http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300136371)which is a modern translation of
the Greek and is delightfully readable.
