Title: "America and Energy Independence"
Tags:

The _[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/business/energy-environment/inching-toward-energy-independence-in-america.html)_ published a
long, but terrifically written recap of our nation's dependence on foreign-
made energy. A worthwhile read for anyone looking to brush
up on all this "domestic oil talk."

> "One day we were rolling in oil," recalled Jim Foreman, the general manager
of the Midland BMW dealership, "and the next day geologists were flipping
burgers at McDonald's."
