Title: "Distro Irony"
Tags:

Skimming through Google+ posts I ran across the great [Linus Torvalds](https://plus.google.com/u/0/102150693225130002912/posts/1vyfmNCYpi5)
complaining that OpenSUSE's security policy was causing problems for his
daughter and her Macbook Air. He closes the rant by
stating:

> .. and now I need to find a new distro that actually works on the Macbook
Air.

To which a commentator responded:

![I think that Apple makes a decent Unix distro that runs on the Macbook Air.](/media/uploads/linuxtorvaldsrantresponse.jpg)

That made my day.
