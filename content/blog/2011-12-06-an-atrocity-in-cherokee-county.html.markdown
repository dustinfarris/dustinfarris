I lived in Canton, GA for the entirety of 2 whole weeks. My
reasons for moving to (and leaving) that city is a separate story, but I have
memories of friendly people, good food, and plenty of nature.
The good 'ol south.

What I_don't_remember is a son-
of-a-bitch who had it in him recently to abuse, rape, and "dispose" of a 7
-year-old girl. This pathetic excuse for a man literally
sexually assaulted a child and then threw her down the garbage chute when he
was finished. I'm usually a stubborn advocate for American
civil rights, due process, human equality and all, but this guy needs to burn.
