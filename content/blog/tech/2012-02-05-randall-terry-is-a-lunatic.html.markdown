Title: "Randall Terry is a Lunatic"

Randall who?

If you haven't heard, there is a madman living in America who thinks it is
appropriate to broadcast ads featuring aborted fetuses during the Super
Bowl. Apparently these ads have already [been running in Iowa](http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/12/aborted-fetus-campaign-ads-hit-airwaves-iowa).

Without getting into too much of a rant, who the _hell _does this lunatic
think he is trying to put a brutal show on a program that families across the
country will be watching? -- families that include
children, and women who have been through the [emotional pains](http://women.webmd.com/tc/abortion-emotional-recovery-topic-overview)
that are often endured after an abortion.

Indeed, who is this insensitive maniac? A quick [Wikipedia search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Terry) reveals that he is a 53
-year-old white male from New York who has been married twice and arrested
more than 40 times in his life. He has filed for
bankruptcy, forged political figures' voices in political ads for personal
gain, and after his son came out of the closet, he publically stated his son
was "no longer welcome in their home."

He has recently put himself on the Democratic primary ticket in several states
in an attempt to steal potential votes from Obama, and to exploit a legal
loophole requiring TV stations to air his anti-abortion ad.
I think it is safe to say I will never take a word of his seriously.
