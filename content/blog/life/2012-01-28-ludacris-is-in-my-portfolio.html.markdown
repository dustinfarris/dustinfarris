Title: "Ludacris is in My Portfolio!"
Tags:

Earlier this month my Wonder colleagues and I wrapped up what is probably my
biggest project to date: a website for the new line of SOUL by Ludacris
headphones. And yes, I think that's pretty cool.

Building the website was a lot of fun, and allowed me to explore Django even
further, as well as pick up a few project management
techniques. Ludacris even came into our office for a photo
shoot!

The true end result was motivation to finally update [my
portfolio](/portfolio/).
