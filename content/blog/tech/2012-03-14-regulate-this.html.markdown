Title: "Regulate This"
Tags:

[James Kwak](http://baselinescenario.com/2012/03/13/americans-like-regulation/) throws an interesting spin on regulation sentiments, stating:

> It's a well-known fact that Americans oppose government spending in the
abstract yet favor virtually every government spending program.

It's fascinating how so much of man-kind can live in the kind of bubble that
restricts you to empathize only with yourself.

> Of course people want stronger food safety regulations when they read
stories about people dying from tainted food; of course they want stronger
environmental protections when they hear about toxic groundwater. At the same
time, exactly half of the political establishment has been on a crusade to
demonize regulation in general for the past forty years.
