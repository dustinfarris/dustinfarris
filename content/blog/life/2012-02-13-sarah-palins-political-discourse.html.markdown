In case you (hopefully) missed it, here are the real show-stoppers from
Palin's [keynote speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ6sXNSgQtY) at the
Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday:

> "We are just dog-gone frustrated with the pace of change!"
>
> "I say keep your change, we'll keep our god, our guns, and our
constitution!"
>
> "Mr. President, we don't want an economy built to last, we want an economy
built to grow!"
>
> "Mr. President, we want your administration to end!"
>
> "'Hope and change', yeah you
better_hope_things change!"
>
> "USA! USA! USA!"
>
> "They're hoppin' in a jacuzzi! America it's time we drain
the jacuzzi and throw the bums out with the bath water!"
>
> "The Tea Party rose up because Americans woke up!"
>
> "We're not red! We're not blue! We are
Red, White, and Blue, and President Obama we
are_through_with you!"

I don't even know where to start.
