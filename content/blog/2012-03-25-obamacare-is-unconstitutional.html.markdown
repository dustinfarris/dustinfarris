Title: "Obamacare is Unconstitutional?"
Tags: [Affordable Care Act]

It seems that our friends on the right have ramped up efforts to [excite citizens](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/us/politics/republicans-attack-health-law-as-supreme-court-hearing-nears.html?ref=affordablecareact) into
thinking the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. The
achingly resounding argument is that forcing people to buy insurance they
don't want is somehow illegal.

I have two responses:

  1. Whoever doesn't want health insurance is out of their mind.
  2. The Congress shall have Power to regulate Commerce among the several States. (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8)

Is [jumping up and down](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/sns-rt-us-healthcare-teapartybre82n0e4-20120324,0,6453307.story) outside of the
Capitol going to change that? No.
