_For Whom the Bell Tolls_ by Ernest Hemingway

Hemingway tells the tale of a rouge U.S. citizen aiding the Spanish Republic
during the Spanish Civil War. The novel hits strongly on a
man's rationale when facing a hard situation.

The protagonist demonstrates admirably level-headed thinking when carrying out
a mission to blow up a bridge to assist a military initiative in fascist
territory. While deep in enemy lands, he meets a girl and
falls in love, and in the end shows us how a man can be willing to give
everything for the right cause.

Having previously finished Adam Smith's _[Wealth of Nations](/2012/3/book-report-wealth-of-nations/)_, I found Ernest Hemingway's
award-winning tale a welcome and thrilling refreshment.
