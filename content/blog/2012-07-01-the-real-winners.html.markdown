Title: "The Real Winners"
Tags: [Affordable Care Act, Paul Krugman]

Economist Paul Krugman offers his view on the recent Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.

From the [New York Times][1]:
> In short, unless you belong to that tiny class of wealthy Americans who are insulated and isolated from the realities of most people’s lives, the winners from that Supreme Court decision are your friends, your relatives, the people you work with — and, very likely, you.
