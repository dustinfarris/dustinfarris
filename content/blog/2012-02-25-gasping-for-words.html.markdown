Title: "Gasping For Words"

Blurting without censorship.

One time-wasting habit of mine I should really break is reading comment
threads on political articles--especially articles dealing with the upcoming
election. The sheer mass of mindless ill-informed, half-
thoughts that commenters spill out is just very sad. What
makes it worse is the complete lack of grammar, spelling ability, and word
choice discernment. I like to call it "Typing Tourett's."

Here is a random example from an ABC News article dealing with, well, it
doesn't really matter:

> UNFORUTANTELY 99% of us cars need oil. And YES, if US produced more OIL, we
would dampen the effects of the world wide oil market. I'm not giving
opinions, nor I'm I stating any left or right wing rhethoic. I'm simply stated
UNDISPUTELY FACTS. But vote for OBAMA anyway. I like 15% unemploymeny, raising
OIL prices, a divided national, unstoppable deficits, a failing dollar, and a
man, who leads by pointing his finger and blaming.

You know, a government in a country such as ours can only be as smart, wise,
and effective as the people who elect it into place. So
look in the mirror America, and _then_ start talking about change.
