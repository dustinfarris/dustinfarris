Title: "Hillary Clinton Speaks to the U.N. on Gay Rights"
Tags:

I donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign during the 2008 primaries, and
although she didn't make it to the final election, I'm glad President Obama
had the intelligence and humility to make her Secretary of State.

Yesterday, December 7, Mrs. Clinton gave a moving speech on the current status
of gay rights, what it means to have human rights, and how the world is
improving and can further improve. Together with President
Obama's recent [powerful speech on the U.S. economy and what needs to be done](http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Robert-Reich/2011/1207/Obama-s-most-important-economic-speech), I am feeling unusually optimistic about our
current administration's future. Of course actions speak
louder than words, but there may be hope for our country yet.
