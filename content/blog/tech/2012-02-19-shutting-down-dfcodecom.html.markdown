Maintaining two blogs has become impossible, so I'm consolidating my writing
to this one. I will migrate the most hit blogs and create
redirects so bookmarks should be good for the rest of the year, but I have no
plans to renew the domain registration when it expires.

Expect more technie-oriented writing here in the near future.
