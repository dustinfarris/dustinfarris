Has anyone else noticed kids punching holes in any piece of flesh they can put
their hands on? To be fair, I had a piercing of my own in
my late teens, but now (in my late 20s) it blows my mind how western
civilization can get away with this.

It's not art, and only expresses lack of anything intelligent to do.
(and yes, I'm speaking to my 18-year-old self)
