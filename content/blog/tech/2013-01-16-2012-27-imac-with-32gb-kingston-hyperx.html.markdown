Title: "2012 27\" iMac with 32GB Kingston HyperX"
Tags: iMac

After nearly 4 years of using a MacbookPro for all things internet, I've finally upgraded my home with a shiny new [27" iMac][1].

The new design is amazing, and yes, it's very, _very_ fast.  The point of this article, though, is to inform anyone curious that Kingston HyperX RAM does in fact work just beautifully with the new iMac.

On Kingston's website, this is not so obvious.  When you select "mac-compatible" RAM they point you to a slightly higher latency RAM that is on par with the factory RAM Apple installs.

Kingston also manufactures equally speced RAM at a lower latency called "HyperX".  This RAM has a CAS latency of 9 and, I'm happy to announce, works just fine with iMac.

I installed 32GB of [KHX16S9P1K2][2] in my iMac, and here are the 64-bit GeekBench results:
