The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky

You'll have to set aside some serious time for this one.
_Brothers Karamazov_ is a loaded book with tons of ironies
and questions to ponder. I've been eyeing this member of my
"list" for some time, and was not disappointed.

Dostoevsky weaves a fabulous murder mystery, but that is not
theluminescence that shines from this gem.
Nearly every page has a hard-hitting point that relates to
life's purpose, our memories, and our relationships. Parts
of the book get political:

> But what comes of this right to increase one's needs? For
the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; for the poor, envy and murder, for
they have been given rights, but have not yet been shown any way of satisfying
their needs.

And other parts deal with our personal struggle with duty and honor:

> Brother... you're not ready, and such a cross is not for you. ... Heavy
burdens are not for everyone, for some they are impossible.

Anyone who is serious about literature absolutely must
give_Brothers Karamazov_a go.
