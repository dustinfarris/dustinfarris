Title: "Missouri and Baby Pictures"
Tags:

Flying back to New York after a lovely weekend in the
Ozarks. I watched my oldest friend from high school get
married and showed my girlfriend fantastic things the
midwest has to offer, like Andy's Frozen Yogurt, and Walmart.

My mother dug out some old pictures and apparently I was blonde
once. Who knew?

I have to say I really appreciate the warm upbringing Missouri gave
me. I think our perspective on the world is significantly
shaped by the environment we grow up in.
