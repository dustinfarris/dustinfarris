Title: "New Blog, New Look"
Tags:

So here it is. Rolling out the new dustinfarris.com with a
new look and a new blog engine. After having gone through 4
_very _different revisions, I've settled on a front end design and a back end
database structure that I'm happy with.

Featured in front is a bright and trim menu bar that's easy to reach, but not
in the way. On the side there is a **collapsible**
companion bar providing quick links to recent blogs, a (not functioning yet)
search bar, and Twitter posts (cough keyword plugs
cough). Still work to do here
obviously. Lastly, I've added some subtle jQuery with more
on the way.

Behind the scenes I've hammered out a blog engine that is finally at least
close to on par with the likes of wordpress and such. Why
am I not using word press, you ask? Because I didn't write
it.

New engine means new database structuring, new dynamic content generation
code, and a fresh off the press upgrade to Django 1.3 (woo hoo!)

Finally, I've added some bells and whistles including a "follow-up" option
that notifies commenters when new comments are added, and an **auto-twitter-
post** method that shortens the URL using my own custom service, updates
Twitter (which in turn updates Facebook), and updates the RSS, all
automatically! Now I just need to automate the actual
writing of a blog and I'll be set. :-)

Well that's it for Dustin's Blog version 4.0. Stay tuned
for actual blogging.
