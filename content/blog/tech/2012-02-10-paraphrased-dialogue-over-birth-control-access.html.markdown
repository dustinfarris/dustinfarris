Title: "Paraphrased Dialogue Over Birth Control Access"
Tags:

After reading various opinion articles and comments therein, here is my
perspective on this week's controversy:

## Beginning of week

OBAMA: Institutions and corporations must follow the same
rules regardless of religious affiliation with regard to providing access to
birth control.

REPUBLICANS: He's a socialist! He's
violating religious freedoms! He just wants to get
reelected!

## 2 days later

OBAMA: Ok, we'll compromise and have this obligation fall on the insurers
instead.

REPUBLICANS: He's a flip-flop! He just
wants to get reelected!
