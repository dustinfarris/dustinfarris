Title: "The Ethics of Globalization"
Tags:

[Dani Rodrik](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rodrik68/English)
shares his thoughts regarding economic globalization and the, often
overlooked, ethical consequences it potentially presents if not well-managed:

> We would think differently if Gates and Buffett had enriched themselves not
through perspiration and inspiration, but by cheating, breaking labor laws,
ravaging the environment, or taking advantage of government subsidies abroad.
If we do not condone redistribution that violates widely shared moral codes at
home, why should we accept it just because it involves transactions across
political borders?
>
> Similarly, when we expect redistributive effects to even out in the long
run, so that everyone eventually comes out ahead, we are more likely to
overlook reshufflings of income. That is a key reason why we believe that
technological progress should run its course, despite its short-run
destructive effects on some. When, on the other hand, the forces of trade
repeatedly hit the same people - less educated, blue-collar workers - we may
feel less sanguine about globalization.
