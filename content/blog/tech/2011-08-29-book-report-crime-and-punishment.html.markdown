Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky

I picked up this book at my new favorite store in Manhattan, [Strand Book Store](http://www.strandbooks.com/). I had an impulsive
itch to read something from Russia, and since I've been lately determined to
read the classics, this seemed like a good pick. Plot about
murder, written by a Russian deviant who spent a few years in the Siberian
prison, raving reviews from anyone who has read it, I figured I couldn't go
wrong. Right I was.

The basic outline of the story involves a Russian student who has dropped out
of university. This man has spent the more recent months of
his life in melodramatic thought, going over certain views and philosophies of
his. One key view he has is that murder, and other crime,
is only a crime when committed by normal people. He
postulated that there is a class of extraordinary citizens to whom the rules
do not apply. His favorite example was Napoleon.
He thinks that committing a crime to achieve a greater good
is forgivable, and should not even be seen as a crime in the first place.

The book explores his inner struggle between his modern theoretical
justification, and his conscience. He never fully admits
feeling "sorry" for his crime, although he does eventually declare that his
reasoning may have been imperfect. (spoiler) He concludes
his journey by confessing his crime so that he may do penance and live a
better life afterwards.

I think Dostoevsky must have had great insight into what motivates certain
people to behave in certain ways. While many if not most of
our actions are dictated by our daily needs, sometimes we are driven to do
great deeds, for better or worse, purely for the sake of our beliefs.
The main character in Crime and Punishment committed murder
to prove to himself that he really believed in his own theory.
He comes up with other excuses (debt, family needs, etc..)
to satiate other simple minded inquisitors, but the underlying reason never
seems to change.

Dostoevsky is a brilliant writer and Crime and Punishment was particularly
easy and fun to read.
