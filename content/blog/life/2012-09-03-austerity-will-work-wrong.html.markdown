Title: "Austerity Will Work!  Wrong."
Tags: [Paul Krugman]

Borrowing a graph from [Krugman][1], I think staging the United State's recovery versus the United Kingdom's gives us an interesting comparison of liberal versus conservative fiscal policy.

Krugman says it best:

>Osborne’s big idea was that Britain should turn to fiscal austerity now now now, even though the economy remained deeply depressed; it would all work out, he insisted, because the confidence fairy would come to the rescue. Never mind those whining Keynesians who said that premature austerity would send Britain into a double-dip recession.

>Strange to say, Britain’s recovery stalled soon after Cameron/Osborne began their new policies, and the country is now in a double-dip recession.
