<p>Dialogues by Plato</p>
<p>This covers 4 of the 5 most popular dialogues written by Plato excluding <em>The
Republic</em> which, as a text that has moved me profoundly, <a href="/2011/10/book-report-the-republic/">will get its own entry</a>.</p>
<p>Plato was a Greek philosopher and friend to the dialectical genius,
Socrates. While the exact history of the man Socrates may
never be fully known, we do know that Plato chose Socrates to exhibit the
ideas presented in his writing.</p>
<p>The dialogue approach to writing that was common in those days is very
appealing to me even in the 21st century. The process of
question and response discovery draws a sort of parrallel to the thoughts that
run through my own head. It is quite gratifying to see your
own thoughts explored, or <a href="http://www.jasonswadley.com/2011/07/uncovering-our-thought-in-aristotle%E2%80%99s/">"uncovered"</a> as a friend of mine wrote,
making the dialogues an especially enjoyable read.</p>
<p>In <em>Apology</em> we learn that Socrates is on trial for his
life. He has the conviction of a man who believes what he
preaches, and makes the best case possible given the short amount of time
allotted.</p>
<p>In <em>Crito</em>, Socrates is in jail awaiting death when his friend pleads with him
to escape. Socrates explains that he must accept the
sentence his government has awarded him. He believes that
although his indictment might have been avoided given more time for a proper
defence, the system of government trumps any selfish bias or desire for "a
little more life."</p>
<p><em>Phaedo</em> was probably the best of these 3 dialogues describing the death of
Socrates in my opinion. Here, Socrates explores the human
soul and offers proof that it not only exists, but has always existed and
forever will. He examins the effect of good and evil on the
soul and assures his friends that although he is to die, his soul will endure
and that death has always been the pursuit of philosophy.</p>
<p>Finally, in <em>Symposium,</em> Plato explores the meaning of Love, what he is, and
how he is encountered. I was hoping for a more revealing
account of love in this text than was provided. The
majority of the dialogue is thoughtless banter regarding the party and
attributing every uplifting word known to man to love.
"Love is majestic, love is pure, love is moving, etc..."
While love is certainly a thing to be praised, I feel that its praise should
be left to poets, not philosophers. In Plato's defense,
according to <em>Symposium</em>, even poets had not yet written a single hymn of
praise to love at that time--something Plato's character, Eryximachus, sought
to remedy.</p>
