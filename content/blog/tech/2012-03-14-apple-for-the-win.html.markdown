Title: "Apple, For The Win"
Tags: Apple

It's been close to three years since we [officially came out of a recession](http://www.economist.com/node/15911334), and pretty much everyone
is doing better, albeit not as much as they might like. A
certain company named Apple, however, has really left the recession in the
dust. From consistently leading consumer electronic brands
to beautiful money management (they don't have a penny of debt), Apple has
really set an example that other aspiring companies would do well to follow.

Today, Apple is trading at just under $600 a share! Here is
Apple's stock value growth over the last 3 years compared with the rest of the
S&P 500:

My only regret from buying Apple stock is not having bought more of it when I
did.
