_The Call of the Wild_ by Jack London

It took me an impressively small amount of time to read this book partly because of short length, and partly because it is one of those books you just can't put down to save your soul.

The Call of the Wild is a story about a dog named Buck who undergoes many deep transformations over the course of his life.  The philosophical undertones characterized by Bucks life demonstrate the impeccable wisdom Jack London must have had.

I'll recommend this book to anyone not only for its spiritual awakening power, but also because it is simply a great story!

>He was a killer, a thing that preyed, living on things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived.
