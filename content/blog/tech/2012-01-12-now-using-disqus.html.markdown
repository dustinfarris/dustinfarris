Title: "Now Using Disqus"
Tags: Disqus

My coworker got me fired up over [Disqus](http://disqus.com/), an attractive
versatile commenting system. It was definitely a good move.

Part of my energy to try something new stemmed from the irritating amount of
spam I've been cleaning out lately. I've been searching for
a solution that I could plug into my current comment system without luck.
Disqus takes care of this.

I like how Disqus is well connected with major social networks.
Really it brings all the network integration a little blog
like mine could ever need and more. And to put icing on the
cake, implementation took literally 30 minutes (including a break to pay for
the Chinese delivery).
