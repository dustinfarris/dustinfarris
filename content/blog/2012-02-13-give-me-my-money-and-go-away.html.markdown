Title: "Give Me My Money and Go Away"
Tags: [Paul Krugman]

A drilldown on hypocrisy.

[Paul Krugman](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/moochers-for-self-reliance/) discusses a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safet-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html?_r=1&src=me&ref=general) that articulates the
ratio of money states give and receive to and from the Federal government
versus their political philosophy:

> So are states that get a lot but don't pay much also states that vote for
candidates demanding self-reliance and an end to Big Government? Basically,
yes. By my reckoning, 7 of the most dependent states in the sense that they
pay relatively little while receiving a lot went for McCain in 2008; only 2 of
the least dependent states did.

Maybe a little introspection is called for.
