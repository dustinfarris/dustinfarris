ETOH - A Cold Lovers' Night

I recently flew to Orlando to play the piano at a wedding for an old friend of
mine. While there, he asked about a song I produced many
years ago called A Cold Lovers' Night. He was interested in
getting a copy, which was understandable--because he wrote it.

Many years have passed since Matias and I wrote and recorded music together,
and I have many fond memories of those days. Work was play,
and play was music, and the whole while we became close friends expressing
ourselves in a way only melodies and rhythms can explain.

We called ourselves ETOH (Entertaining Thoughts Of Happiness), and though we
never did much with our recordings, I will always cherish the prints of our
lives we left behind.
