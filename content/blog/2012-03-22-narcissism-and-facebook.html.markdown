Title: "Narcissism, and Facebook"
Tags: Facebook

[Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5895372/the-more-facebook-friends-you-have-the-more-unhappy-you-probably-are) recently discussed research showing a
correlation between levels of narcissism in an individual and the number of
Facebook friends he or she has.

Via [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/17/facebook-dark-side-study-aggressive-narcissism):

> People who score highly on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory
questionnaire had more friends on Facebook, tagged themselves more often and
updated their newsfeeds more regularly.
>
> The research comes amid increasing evidence that young people are becoming
increasingly narcissistic, and obsessed with self-image and shallow
friendships.

Last year I performed a "friend" purge on my account, removing more than 200
friends whom, well, weren't really my friends. I have to
admit, it felt pretty good.
