Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut

While being sufficiently entertaining enough to read quickly, I did not seem
to capture the awe that so many others have when reading this book.
However, Vonnegut offers a few interesting ideas throughout
his novel: one being that there is no such thing as time--that we are forever
frozen in all moments of existence.

Kurt Vonnegut writes in a style that is easy to absorb. I'm
sure many people would get a kick out of this book in particular--which is
probably why it was listed in [Time Magazine's 100 best English-language
novels written since 1923](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-
Five#Literary_significance_and_reception).

> "That is a very _Earthling _question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim.
Why _you?_ Why _us _for that matter?
Why _anything?_ Because this moment
simply _is_."
