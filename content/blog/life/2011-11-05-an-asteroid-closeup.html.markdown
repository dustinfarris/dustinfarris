Title: "An Asteroid Closeup"
Tags:

It looks like the folks in astronomy are getting a treat Tuesday night.
An asteroid the size of "4 city blocks" is going to come
closer to Earth than the moon!

> Scientists say the asteroid won't hit us, but it will be barely more than
200,000 miles away when it passes Earth at 11:13 p.m. Tuesday, and in cosmic
terms that's really close.
